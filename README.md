- Dropped out of college in my third year (because I didnâ€™t get a good education after entering college, instead I wasted money and time)
- I started learning online in May last year through various channels, such as Coursera, Edx, Youtube, Stanford Online, mit opencourseware, etc., with the idea of learning computer science.
- I will include my course assignments and notes on github, as well as some of the projects I want to do (which are far from enough at the moment).
- Working from home.
- My goal is to be an independent developer, a digital nomad, and of course a little bit of investment.
